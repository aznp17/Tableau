📊 Pokémon Stats Analysis & Evolution ⚡️Tableau Portfolio ProjectProject OverviewThis project explores the evolution of Pokémon base statistics (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.) across different generations, aiming to identify trends, power creep, and statistical balance over the franchise's lifespan. It is a key piece in my Tableau Dashboarding Portfolio, demonstrating my skills in data preparation, advanced visual design, and interactive storytelling.The primary goal was to answer the question: Have the base stats of Pokémon changed significantly or increased over the generations?Key Features & VisualizationsThis dashboard uses several key interactive visualizations to communicate the findings:Generation Power Trend: A line or area chart showing the average Total Base Stats (HP + Attack + Defense + Sp. Atk + Sp. Def + Speed) plotted over each of the $N$ existing Pokémon generations. (This is where the power creep analysis is visible.)Type Strengths: A packed bubble chart or treemap comparing the average stats across all 18 Pokémon types (e.g., Water, Fire, Grass), highlighting which types have the highest defensive or offensive averages.Stat Distribution Heatmap: A heatmap displaying the distribution of individual Base Stats (HP, Attack, etc.) within a selected Generation, allowing users to see which stats are most common or rare.Legendary Impact: A toggle or filter that lets the user compare the average stats of Legendary and Mythical Pokémon against their non-Legendary counterparts across generations.
