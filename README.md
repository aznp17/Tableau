# 📊 Pokémon Stats Analysis & Evolution ⚡️

## **Tableau Portfolio Project**

### **Project Overview**

This project explores Pokemon's presense in the media and the evolution of Pokémon games (Pokemon type, Attack, Special Attack, Defense, and Special Defense) across different generations, aiming to identify trends and statistical balance over the franchise's lifespan (up to 7th generation). It is a key piece in my **Tableau Dashboarding Portfolio**, demonstrating my skills in data preparation, advanced visual design, and interactive storytelling.

The primary goal was to answer the question: **How has Pokémon changed significantly over the generations?**

### **Key Features & Visualizations**

This dashboard uses several key interactive visualizations to communicate the findings:

* **Media Dominance:** Pie charts indicating how 
* **Generation Power Trend:** A line or area chart showing the average *Total Base Stats* (HP + Attack + Defense + Sp. Atk + Sp. Def + Speed) plotted over each of the existing Pokémon generations. *(This is where the power creep analysis is visible.)*
* **Type Strengths:** A packed bubble chart or treemap comparing the average stats across all **18 Pokémon types** (e.g., Water, Fire, Grass), highlighting which types have the highest defensive or offensive averages.
* **Stat Distribution Heatmap:** A heatmap displaying the distribution of individual Base Stats (HP, Attack, etc.) within a selected Generation, allowing users to see which stats are most common or rare.

### **Tools & Technologies**

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tableau Desktop / Public** | Primary tool for data visualization and dashboard creation. |
| **Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets** | Initial data cleaning, restructuring, and calculation of Total Base Stats. |
| **GitHub** | Version control and portfolio hosting. |
| **Source Data** | Comprehensive dataset covering all generations of Pokémon with base stats. |


### **Reflections & Learning Points**

* **Challenge:** The most significant challenge was standardizing the data, as stat names and types evolved slightly across various source datasets. This required careful **data blending** and **cross-referencing**.
* **Key Insight:** The analysis confirms a subtle but measurable **power creep** over generations, with certain stat distributions becoming more common (e.g., higher average Special Attack).
* **Future Enhancements:** I plan to incorporate additional data points, such as **Abilities** and **Held Items**, to model a more complete competitive landscape.

### **Getting Started (For Contributors/Reviewers)**

This repository contains all the necessary files to recreate the dashboard:

* `Pokemon_Stats_Dataset.csv`: The clean, final dataset used for the visualization.
* `Pokemon_Stats_Analysis.twb` or `Pokemon_Stats_Analysis.twbx`: The Tableau Workbook file.
* `Tableau_Screenshots/`: Folder containing high-resolution images of the final dashboard.
