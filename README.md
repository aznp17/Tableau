# 📊 Pokémon Stats Analysis & Evolution ⚡️

## **Tableau Portfolio Project**

### **Project Overview**

This project explores Pokemon's presense in the media and the evolution of Pokémon games (Pokemon type, Attack, Special Attack, Defense, and Special Defense) across different generations, aiming to identify trends and statistical balance over the franchise's lifespan (up to 7th generation). It is a key piece in my **Tableau Dashboarding Portfolio**, demonstrating my skills in data preparation, advanced visual design, and interactive storytelling.

The primary goal was to answer the question: **How has Pokémon changed significantly over the generations?**

### **Key Features & Visualizations**

This dashboard uses several key interactive visualizations to communicate the findings:

* **Media Dominance:** Pie charts indicating Pokemon's relevance, bar charts comparing games sold and pokemon cards sold, histograms and star charts comparing Pokemon attack stats. 
* **Generation Power Trend:** A star chart showing the average *Total Base Stats* (Attack + Defense + Sp. Atk + Sp. Def + Speed) plotted over each of the existing Pokémon generations. 
* **Type Strengths:** A packed bubble chart comparing the Pokemon types across all generations highlighting which generation has the most variety Pokemon types.

### **Tools & Data**

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tableau Desktop** | Primary tool for data visualization and dashboard creation. |
| **GitHub** | Version control and portfolio hosting. |
| **Source Data** | Comprehensive dataset covering all generations of Pokémon with base stats. |


### **Reflections & Learning Points**
* **Limitations:** This analysis only discusses the Pokemon's Type 1 stats and not the moves tied to the stats**.
* **Key Insight:** The developers made the psychic Pokemon too powerful and rebalanced by introducing the Dark and Steep type Pokemon. However, the Dragon type then dominated the next generation with led to the creation of the Fairy type Pokemon. 
* **Future Enhancements:** A plan to incorporate additional data points, such as **Abilities** and **Held Items**, to model a more complete competitive landscape.
